The solution of the problem is the “main_basic.py” script. You can run it without installing any external library.



“GUI_prototype.py” is a script that allows you to select a file (.txt) easier than directly using the “main_basic.py” Python script.Also, it gives you an image of the receipt. You can select a directory path that contains multiple  (.txt) files, then it will take all of them.

Finally, you must install (Pillow==9.2.0) on your virtual environment. You can use this command “pip install -r  libraries.txt”
